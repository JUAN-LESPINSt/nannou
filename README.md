# 🌟 Project Overview :

I've just completed a systems engineering project, a container orchestration tool called **omniauthtml**, which I built using Go, Node.js, and Rust. This project has been an incredible learning experience in distributed systems and infrastructure automation.

## 🛠️ Core Components

- **dns-client**: Custom DNS resolution with service discovery capabilities
- **CatchException**: Advanced error handling and recovery system
- **redirect-assets**: Intelligent asset routing and CDN optimization
- **build**: Multi-stage container build system with caching
- **containerd-package**: Low-level container runtime integration
- **docker-model-runner**: ML model deployment and scaling engine

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The **omniauthtml** platform **orchestrates distributed applications across hybrid cloud environments**. 

It provides:

- **Service Discovery**: Automatic registration and discovery using **dns-client**
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient error recovery with **CatchException** middleware
- **Asset Management**: Smart routing through **redirect-assets** proxy layer
- **Container Orchestration**: Multi-runtime support via **containerd-package**
- **AI/ML Deployment**: Scalable inference with **docker-model-runner**
- **Cluster Management**: Distributed coordination using **ClusteringNodeJS**
- **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing with **elixir-bean** backends
- **Security Layer**: Zero-trust networking with **Cosar** framework
- **Monitoring**: Advanced metrics collection from **2049-AI** telemetry
- **Data Validation**: Integrity checks using **data-cheat-sheet** schemas

## 📚 Key Technical Learnings

- **Distributed Systems**: Implementing consensus algorithms and distributed coordination patterns
- **Container Runtimes**: Deep integration with containerd and Docker engine APIs
- **Network Programming**: Building custom DNS resolvers and service mesh components
- **Error Resilience**: Designing fault-tolerant systems with graceful degradation
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management and concurrency in Go/Rust
- **API Design**: Creating clean, versioned APIs for extensibility
- **Security Implementation**: Zero-trust architecture and secure service communication
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Distributed tracing and metric collection
- **CI/CD Automation**: Multi-stage builds and automated deployment pipelines
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API docs and operational runbooks
